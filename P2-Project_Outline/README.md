### Overview
My project will be an online training platform for blue collar workers to learn trades and get connected with jobs in their industry. Users will be able to create an account, log in, take a course involving watching videos, working through practice problems, submitting assignments, and taking quizzes. They will be able to review all courses, modules within the course, and upcoming modules.

I decided to make this project because there is a gap in the blue collar work force currently, and this will be my next business venture. I want to make trades more accessible, especially for foster kids aging out of the system who do not have a family to provide college education for them, or the means to support a college education. This application can be beneifical for anyone wanting to work in a trade as an alternative to college, and be able to do it from anywhere.


### Features

- User Sign up: Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to work through a course on a trade they are interested in.
- User Login: Users will be able to login after creating a profile. Passwords will be hashed, salted, and possibly peppered.
- Watch videos, complete assignments, and complete quizzes: Users will work through various units of aspects of the program they need to learn via watching videos, moving to the next page where they work through an example, then complete a quiz at the end of the unit. 
- View Course Progress: Users will be able to see their progress through the class, including completed assignments and quizzes.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am new to JS and Agile. I understand HTTP Requests, HTTP Responses, and serving up templates. I will have to do some research on what is available, and what makes sense for a project of this size. I also will have to dive deeper into Agile to manage my framework.
